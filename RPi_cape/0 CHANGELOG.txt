	* Connected RPi_Valve* signals to larger CPLD footprint, changed Raspberry Pi pin assignment as a result to ease PCB routing
	* Updated footprints, page layout to create readable assembly drawing
	* Added current-measurement testpoints for CPLD power from BATT+
	* Changed power diodes in power-down-alarm circuit to small-signal parts for more compact layout
	
1.5 to 1.6:
	* Switched CPLD_ADC7 to +24V monitoring (from +5V monitoring), and added CPLD ~Bat_On digital input(s) to know when it's running from backup battery, to cover low-input-voltage edge cases
	* Added series 1K resistors (R226-231) on CPLD<->RPi Comms1-6 lines, to protect CPLD in case of overvoltage from RPi failure
	* Added optional input TVS D23 to handle sustained over-voltage or large surges
	
1.6 to 1.7:
	* Separated +1.8V and +5VA monitoring and added +3.3V output for +5VA on ~5VA_On signal to CPLD, to cover an extra failure mode
	
1.7 to 1.8:
	* Toughened under-voltage detect circuits by adding hysteresis to +5V detect for +BATT diode-OR (R236), filtering to power-down alarm detect input (C85)
	* Added connector options (J15, J21) for Grayhill C14-series rotary encoder with cable
	* Changed R190 from 3K to 2.4K to increase overhead on base current required for saturation, and consolidate BOM
	* Added 3 solderable testpoints for expanding CPLD pin options (TP44-46), adjusted some CPLD pin assignments to allow physical routing to pins
	* Fixed valve motion detector by changing comparator's hysteresis to AC-only, changing NPN's series resistor to 1K (allows low-enough DC level to count as logic low), and adding optional filtering cap C115 to offset divider
	
1.8 to 1.9:
	* Changed 24V LED resistors (R20, R22) to 24.9K to consolidate BOM

1.10 to 1.11:
	* Swapped Max V CPLD for Max 10 FPGA
	* Removed +1.8V regulator and monitoring (in power-down alarm) because Max 10 FPGA has internal regulator
	* Changed FPGA's valve-enable pull-downs from 1K to 10K because Max 10 floats the outputs during power-up/programming (instead of Max V's internal pull-ups)
	* Changed low-pressure sensor from BMP388 to MS5607 for more manufacturable footprint / high availability, and moved all digital pressure sensors to daughterboard for repairability
