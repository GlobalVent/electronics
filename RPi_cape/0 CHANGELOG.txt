1.0 to 1.1:
	* Added R177 to allow low-battery alarm to drive both a CPLD input and an external LED
	* Moved one Raspberry Pi PWM analog output to GPIO18 to take advantage of hardware PWM
	* Fixed floating shutdown pin on audio amp U28
	* Added bulk capacitor C112 on +5V input
	
1.1 to 1.2:
	* Added R185, R186 to allow powering CPLD from alarm power for better power-down alarm sound flexibility
	* Changed power-down alarm monitoring from +5VD to +3.3V, and put +5VA and +24VA monitoring as DNP by default, to match the CPLD's ability to run off backup battery and monitor +5VA/+24VA
	* Moved from 3x AA (4.5V) to 4x AA (6V) alarm battery for better audio voltage, and added PNP diode-ORing circuit (Q12 etc.) to accomodate higher voltage, changed low-battery threshold to 5V
	* Added pull-down resistors to sensor op-amp outputs to help extend low-end output range
	* Changed 1nF, 10nF, 100nF caps to 0603-size for better fit of CPLD decoupling caps
	* Added additional bulk cap C19 to audio amp's supply just in case of alarm-induced supply fluctuations
	* Decreased CPLD's I2C pull-up values to deal with anticipated PCB capacitance etc.
	* Removed additional dual-op-amp footprint option on analog inputs, due to high availability of single op-amps
	* Adjusted O2 sensor input clamping to reduce errors from diode leakage current (changed from zener to low-leakage clamps to rails)
	* Changed O2 sensor op-amp to different lower-offset part to reduce total error from +/- 4.2% FS to +/- 1.7% FS
	* Fixed missing power section for U17
	* Added rotary encoder input
	* Consolidated +5VA fuse options
	
1.2 to 1.3:
	* Moved rotary encoder inputs to CPLD
	* Removed separate decoupling caps for smaller CPLD footprint due to routing constraints
	* Added pull-downs on CPLD inputs for each valve driver (R198 etc.)
	
1.3 to 1.4:
	* Added two digital pressure sensors each, on Raspberry Pi and CPLD I2C busses
	* Added gnd plane on bottom layer for heatsinking 5V regulators
	
1.4 to 1.5:
	* Added strain-relief slots and barb mounting dimensions for digital pressure sensors
	* Changed valve drivers from discrete power MOSFETs to "smart" industrial/automotive driver ICs for the current monitoring, including valve-movement monitor for #4
	* Connected RPi_Valve* signals to larger CPLD footprint, changed Raspberry Pi pin assignment as a result to ease PCB routing
	* Updated footprints, page layout to create readable assembly drawing
	* Added current-measurement testpoints for CPLD power from BATT+
	* Changed power diodes in power-down-alarm circuit to small-signal parts for more compact layout
	
1.5 to 1.6:
	* Switched CPLD_ADC7 to +24V monitoring (from +5V monitoring), and added CPLD ~Bat_On digital input(s) to know when it's running from backup battery, to cover low-input-voltage edge cases
	* Added series 1K resistors (R226-231) on CPLD<->RPi Comms1-6 lines, to protect CPLD in case of overvoltage from RPi failure
	* Added optional input TVS D23 to handle sustained over-voltage or large surges
	
1.6 to 1.7:
	* Separated +1.8V and +5VA monitoring and added +3.3V output for +5VA on ~5VA_On signal to CPLD, to cover an extra failure mode
