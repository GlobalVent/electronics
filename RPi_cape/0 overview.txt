Power:
	+24V and GNDPWR are noisy 24V for solenoid valves
	+24VA and GND are quiet 24V for sensors - this is derived from filtered +24V/GNDPWR
	+5VD is digital Raspberry Pi power, kept separate from FPGA and analog power for reliability
	+5V is digital FPGA power and alarm power (when not running off backup battery)
	+5VA is analog (sensor conditioning, limit comparator) power - derived from filtered +5V
	+3.3V is digital FPGA power, output combining-logic power - regulated by LDO from +5V, or optionally alarm backup battery when +5V down
	+3.3VA is digital FPGA power, filtered for FPGA's onboard PLL
	+BATT is the diode-OR'ed alarm power, from either +5V or the 6V (4x AA) alarm backup battery
	
Options:
	* +24V power redundancy:
		Redundant: Populate both diodes (D1-2) and use all 4 pins of J1
		Non-redundant: Only populate D1 and use pins 1, 2 of J1
	* Power sources:
		Internal: Use "internal" (open-frame / closed-frame / DIN rail) AC-DC power supplies, 1x 24V + 2x 5V, and feed to spring terminals J1 and J3-4, onboard 5V power supplies U34-35 are DNP - less EMI risk, more FDA voltage safety risk
		External: Use "external" (wall- / desktop) AC-DC 24V power supply, and feed to spring terminals J1, onboard 5V power supplies U34-35 are populated and 5V input spring terminals J3-4 are unused - more EMI risk, less FDA voltage safety risk
	* +24V power fusing:
		No global fusing: populate R4, remove F1
		Global fusing: populate F1, remove R4 - likely unnecessary as +24VA and each individual solenoid driver has its own fusing
	* FPGA power
		FPGA powered from analog +5V: populate R186 and +5VA/+24VA monitoring on power-down alarm (D37-38), remove R185, remove +3.3V monitoring on power-down alarm (D41) - less drain on backup battery when active, possible other unforeseen consequences
		FPGA powered from alarm power (analog +5V when present, backup battery otherwise): populate R185, remove R186 and +5VA/+24VA monitoring on power-down alarm (D37-D38), add +3.3V monitoring on power-down alarm (D41) - FPGA can sound better (standard IEC 60601-1-8) alarms on power down than the hardwired 1-sec beep
	* RPi/FPGA output combining for valve drivers:
		AND (both outputs required to turn on valve): Populate U8 etc. as 74LVC1G08
		OR (either output can turn on valve): Populate U8 etc. as 74LVC1G32
	* Valve driver monitoring options:
		Current sense signal to FPGA's ADC: U9 etc. is TPS1H100B, populate R59=10K and Valve Motion Detection section; remove R58, R8-R9 - can't measure +5VA rail through FPGA's ADC ch.6
		Digital fault output to FPGA's IO: U9 etc. is TPS1H100A, populate R58=0, R8=10K, R9=1K; remove R59 and Valve Motion Detection section - can measure +5VA rail through FPGA's ADC ch.6, no valve movement detection
	* Analog input clamping:
		Absolute voltage (Zener): populate D11 etc., remove D10 etc.
		Clamp to rail (rectifier): populate D10 etc., remove D11 etc.
	* Valve driver fusing:
		PTC resettable fuse: Populate F6, etc. - possibility of going back to normal from temporary fault (although still likely too slow to protect MOSFET)
		Normal one-time fuse: Populate F10, etc. - faster response time, more likely to protect
	* Valve default Raspberry Pi output state:
		Default low Raspberry Pi output in case of power loss: populate R53 etc., remove R55 etc.
		Default high: populate R55 etc., remove R53 etc.
	* Low-battery output for alarm backup battery
		FPGA handles low-battery notification (and/or passes it on to the Raspberry Pi to display/report): populate R146, R177; remove R145, Q8, R147, J13
		LED lit on front panel: populate R145, Q8, R147, J13; remove R146, R177
		Both FPGA input and LED: populate R145, Q8, R147, J13, R177=10K-100K; remove R146
	* FPGA reset for brownout/slow power-up:
		External brownout detect: populate D33, R37, Q3
		Internal FPGA power-on reset only: remove D33, R37, Q3
